What are we gonna do with all this empty space?,Marketplace / Kai Ryssdal,"Wed, 10 Jan 2024 00:10:05 +0000","<p>Nearly 20% of office spaces across the U.S. are vacant, new data shows. Many companies solidified their back-to-office policies in the past year, so why are buildings emptier than ever?

Also in this episode: The Biden administration passed a new rule that could classify millions more gig workers as employees, and economists aren&#8217;t concerned about the U.S. trade deficit.</p>"
According to my Magic 8 Ball …,Marketplace / Kai Ryssdal,"Tue, 09 Jan 2024 00:19:15 +0000","<p>It&#8217;s a new year, and that means experts — and nonexperts — have lots of guesses about what 2024 may hold. In this episode, we&#8217;ll talk about some of those predictions. Will inflation hit to 3%? Will consumer credit keep ticking up? Will gas prices drop below $3 a gallon? Signs point to yes. Plus, Houston has been nationally recognized for its successful Housing First approach to homelessness. But keeping up those programs will mean more funding, especially as housing costs rise.</p>"
In? Ice cream. Out? Cookies.,Marketplace / Kai Ryssdal,"Fri, 05 Jan 2024 23:27:22 +0000","<p>In/out lists are, like, so &#8220;in&#8221; right now.

In this episode, we&#8217;ll hear from sociologist Reuben Jonathan Miller, who studies what he calls the &#8220;afterlife&#8221; of incarceration, about how we can better support formerly incarcerated individuals and why he&#8217;s focusing on those charged with violent crimes. Plus, it&#8217;s getting harder to identify ghost jobs, and &#8220;little change&#8221; is good news for the job market.</p>"

Bring down drug prices.,Marketplace / Kai Ryssdal,"Fri, 29 Dec 2023 23:45:43 +0000","<p>One in seven Medicare beneficiaries surveyed reported not filling a prescription due to high cost. The Inflation Reduction Act was meant to change this by allowing Medicare to negotiate the prices of 10 medications beginning in 2024. It&#8217;ll be a balancing act — bring prices down enough that they&#8217;re affordable, but not so low that drug companies exit the Medicare market. Also in this episode: French wineries suffer as red wine consumption drops, and new OSHA rules bring more transparency to on-the-job accidents at 50,000 workplaces.</p>"
